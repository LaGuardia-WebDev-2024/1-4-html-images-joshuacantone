        <h1>Joshua's trip to mars</h1>

        <p>I would see scenes like...</p>
        <ul>
            <li>rocks</li>
            <li>sand</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The lush landscapes of the red planet are a feast for the eyes. and complimented by the starry void above, many have gone for the views alone.</p>

        <p>And animals like...</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Martain man hunter</li>
        </ul>
        <p>He's a very cool man. He's green </p>

        <p>And eat food like...</p>
        <ul>
            <li>rocks</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Though not a destination often praised for its cuisine, the martian culture is rich and deep, much like it's manny dishes, which consist of the two most common ingredients; sand and rock. </p>
